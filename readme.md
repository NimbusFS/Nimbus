## Nimbus
Nimbus brings a native file management experience to [CloudApp](www.getcloudapp.com). Using FUSE, it creates a virtual filesystem representing the files you've uploaded, and allows you to sort, open, or Quicklook them as you would to real files. If you delete a file, it gets deleted from CloudApp. If you drop a file in, it gets uploaded. 

## Kickstarter Backers
Thank you for your support! Feel free to fork Nimbus and mess around before we're ready with our first beta.

## Running
Because Nimbus is a FUSE filesystem, you will need to install [osxfuse](http://osxfuse.github.com/). The final versions will install FUSE for you if it doesn't exist yet.
